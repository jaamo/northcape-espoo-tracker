# Micro blog for Northcape - Espoo ride 

This is a simple micro blogging platform for my Northcape - Espoo ride in 2018. My goal is to post small updates or check-ins during my ride and I don't want to spam my social media channels. Updates are displayed on a map.

* Vue and Vuex are used as a framework
* Google Maps is used as a map
* Data is loaded from Contentful
